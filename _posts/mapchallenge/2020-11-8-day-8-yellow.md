Methods: The different size of the hexagons was achieved by using a centroid fill and marker symbol for every hexagon and data driven symbology based on the number of the farms. Shadow effect was applied by using the Draw effects. Font [Potra Light](https://www.fontspace.com/potra-light-font-f29815)
