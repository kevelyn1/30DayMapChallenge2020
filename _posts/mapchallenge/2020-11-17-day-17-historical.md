Lord of The Rings style Estonia that looks historical style, although is a fantasy. This map has been created already before, so a little bit of cheating ;)
The QGIS style created for this map is available [on my github](https://github.com/kevelyn1/qgis_styles/tree/master/LOTR_style)

Used tools: QGIS
Data: Estonian Land Board
