The green infrastructure strategy aims to preserve or re-create a system of functioning green areas
and facilities that are cohesive and sufficiently compact at various geographical levels, enable species
to migrate and adapt to climate change, enrich the living environment of people, and support ecosystem services and benefits.

Data: Estonian Environment Agency, [Hendrikson&Co](https://hendrikson.ee/maps/Rohev%c3%b5rgustiku-andmebaas/) 
Unfortunately the spatial layers are only for viewing and not for downloading. I obtained them for research purposes.
Tools: QGIS
