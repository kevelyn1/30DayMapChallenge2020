Active COVID cases in Estonia mapped as individual random points in the administrative units. I guess this illustrates a bit how likely you are to bump into a COVID in different areas. In rural and remote areas the density of COVID-cases is pretty low whereas in the cities it is high.

Used tools: QGIS
Data: Estonian Health and Welfare Information Systems
